# angular-tvshows

*Tv shows app created with Angular and [BetaSeries API](//www.betaseries.com/api/docs)*

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-tvshows repository and install the dependencies.

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-tvshows repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

I also use a number of node.js tools to run angular-tvshows. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-tvshows

Clone the angular-tvshows repository using [git](http://git-scm.com/) :

```
git clone https://github.com/antoineneff/angular-tvshows.git
cd angular-tvshows
```

### Install Dependencies

In this project, I'm using Gulp to handle my SASS files and Angular framework. All you have to do is download the dependencies to make this work.
To do so, you just have to run :

```
npm install
```

### Run the application

I have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is :

```
npm start
```

I'm using Browser-sync with Gulp so every change in the files (html, css or js) will automatically refresh your browser !
